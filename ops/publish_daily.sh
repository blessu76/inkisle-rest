# Daily publish (one post a day, 19:00 KST): pull -> push leftovers -> publish_post --daily -> green gate -> commit -> push -> live check -> IndexNow.
# Install notes: ops/README.md. Needs: python3, git (non-interactive push access to origin), network for IndexNow.
#
# Safety rules
#   - Runs only in a dedicated publish clone (INKISLE_PUBLISH_DIR, default ~/Developer/inkisle-rest) that is checked out on `main` with a clean tree;
#     otherwise it does nothing and exits 0 (see the log). Never point it at a clone where feature branches / work in progress live.
#   - Local commits not yet on origin/main (a previous push failed) are pushed first, even when there is nothing new to publish.
#   - Publishing is all-or-nothing: if anything before the commit fails (publish_post, the green gate, the path check, git add/commit, SIGTERM), the tree is reset to the commit it started from.
#   - One run at a time: .git/publish.lock (stale after its process is gone or 3 h).
#   - Only the paths a publish creates are staged (never `git add -A`).
# Test hooks: INKISLE_CHECK_CMD (default "bash scripts/check.sh"), INKISLE_SKIP_NET=1 (no sleep / live check / IndexNow).
